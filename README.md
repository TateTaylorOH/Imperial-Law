[Lawbringer ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29882)﻿is a great mod that I have recently fallen in love with. It allows you to claim locations around Skyrim for a faction of your choice, ensuring that it will only respawn in the future with friendly NPCs. It is really enjoyable to claim locations and see a tangible impact on the world around you. Places like Valtheim Keep and Pine Watch Bridge are fun locations because they are bandit camps stationed on the roadway, so claiming feels very impactful.

I am sad there are not more modules to expand Lawbringer's system to other part of Skyrim or other modded locations. So I decided I would make one myself. This mod will bring Lawbringer functionality to three locations in Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil!

County Bruma sits in the far north of Cyrodiil, bordering Skyrim to the south. This region is a melting pot of Imperial and Nordic ideals, the architecture in the city proper is reminiscant of both culture's stylings. The outbreak of the Skyrim Civil War has had an impact on the county, the occsional bit of violence spills south and the strife caused by the conflict has lead to an increase of bandit activity across the region. The county governance has done its best to protect its citizens and ensure that Imperial Law is upheld.

Cracked Horn Camp is a old Reman Empire ruin that is occupied by a camp of minotaurs. The ruin sits just north of Lakeside Retreat on a path from County Bruma into County Cheydinhal. Capturing this gate would help Bruma to defend its southern border.

Lakeside Retreat is a lakeside cottage overrun by bandits, located northeast of The Beast's Maw and southwest of Rock Creek Camp. The cottage was once the home of an Imperial and Khajiit couple, but has since been taken over by a group of bandits. Running the bandits out of this house will make it safe for new residents to move in.

Plump Rat Camp is a bandit camp located just southwest of Reman's Fist and south of Underpall Cave. The camp straddles a side road leading south from the main road to Chorrol, and is overlooked by Reman's Fist, which provides an excellent sniping spot. Securing this location would help keep the southern county safe.

Plundered Mine is a small mine containing bandits, located south of Gautierre Manor and east of Bruma Eastern Watchtower. This mine is a valuable source of copper that would be of great benefit to Bruma if it could be captured.
